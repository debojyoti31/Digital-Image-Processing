# Digital Image Processing in Python from Scratch

Welcome to this repository, here you will find implementations of some basic digital image processing algorithms in Python, without using any external libraries.

## Usage

The codes are provided in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. To use the codes, you need to have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Simply clone or download the repository and navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.

Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
```jupyter notebook```

This will open a new browser window, where you can navigate to the notebooks and run the code cells.
